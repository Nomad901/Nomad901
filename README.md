I am a passionate C++ and C# game developer with a deep-seated drive for learning and innovation. My fascination with games, which began in my earliest years, has evolved into a career dedicated to bringing imaginative worlds to life.
My technical skills include graphics programming with OpenGL/C++ and game development with Unity/C#. My work in OpenGL sparked a profound interest in 3D graphics, which I further explore through 3D modeling in Blender as a hobbyist, creating a substantial library of personal assets.
I am currently channeling this passion into developing my own 3D game engine, Tango Engine, laying the foundation for my future projects. I am thrilled by the challenge of turning ambitious dreams into tangible, interactive experiences.
